## Advancing Technologies in HealthCare RCM 
   ##  Overview and Origin

* R1 rcm [(<https://www.r1rcm.com/>)] 

* R1 rcm was incorporated in 2003 as Accretive Health. In 2017 it was named to what we know now as R1 rcm. The company was initially founded by two visionaries, Mary Tolen and Michael Cline, who joined forces to establish the company.*4
 The company came about out of a need following a signifcant patient data breach at Accrretive health. After several years of Senate inquiries and adapting to stringent regulatory requirements R1rcm was created. 

 R1rcm initially was funded by the companies founders, with their own private investing and creating stratgic partnerships. *1  Today it is funded by institutional investors, individual insiders, and mutual fund holders. *2

## Business Activities

* R1 continues to try and solve the inequities of productivity, decrese administrative burdens and bolster revenue.   R1 partners with health systems to increase their revenue cycle performance, their staff productivity, and ultimatly the patients experience from beginning to end. *4

* R1rcm centers its customer focus on Health system, hospitals, medical groups, physicians though out the United States.  

>" R1 is the leading provider of technology-driven solutions that transform the patient experience and financial performance of hospitals, health systems and medical groups.

## Landscape

* There have been many innovations in this field. We see regulatory changes every year. These have been prevelant in creating a patient experienced focus in health care. There have been recent regulatory changes just late last year regarding pricing transparency to patients by both health systems and the health insurace industry. Additionally we see regulatory changes regarding paitient privacy, updates to medical diagnosis coding allowing a more comprehensive catogorization, and last but not least changes in value based care by physicians and hospitals.

Satisfied and partnering health systems. This is seen with metrics used in healthcare of revenue increase, acquisitions and partnerships increase. 

* R1 rcm is a top provider in their field.  Revenue growth has increased year over year and is expected to continue. R1 continues to develop and launch technologies that are cutting edge for the field and specialize in end to end  revenue cycle management that very few are able to do currently.

## Recommendations

* I would recommend integrating AI and LLM with full payer contract management, negotiation, and credentialling services. Developing and using LLM and AI to continue to be a solution to Healthcare reveune challanges. R1 is in a unique space of partnering with healthsystems, being able to analyize on a large scale payer reimburements, payer contractual agreements, and market standards, individually and nationally.  R1 can provide an analytical approache to leverage the best reimbursments possible for the client.  

* This would help the client tremedously as most Health systems do not have the resourses available to manage there payer contracts at any level.  

* AI and LLM would be required to read and extract key details of the contract documents. Catagorize, contol and monitor inventory of documents, predict advantageous renegotiations based on health system service usages. 

* Managing payer and facility contracting is heavy in data transfering. Payer contract documents are very lenghty sometimes over 1000 pages of text per document and can have many re-itterations to keep track of and to manually read the documents to discover the information required, and currently an extremely manual and labor intensive process.  LLM would be extremly useful to find specific information needed for platforms used in the company. Providing date and time tracking for renewals, inventory tracking for the clients, concise information at a glace. Establishing use of LLM internally will increase staff productivity which will intern increase results to clients and utlimatly patients.
