## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) Full payer contract management and negotiation and credentialling. R1 is in a unique space of having detailed information regarding payer contracts with the specific healthsystem,oversite knowlege of indutry standards and insight into the specific healthsystem standards.  We can also provide a solution for many health systems struggeling to manage and negotiate their payer contracts with payers. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? Its one of the last parts of the rcm we currently dont do. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? AI and LLM would be required to read extract key details of the contract documents. Catagorize, contol and monitor inventory of documents, predict advantageous renegotiations based on health system service usages. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? Managing payer and facility contracting is heavy in data transfering. Payer contract documents are very lenghty sometimes over 1000 pages of text per document and can have many re-itterations to keep track of. its extremely labor intensive.  LLM would be extremly useful to find specific information needed for platfomrs. It could provide date and time tracking for renewals, inventory tracking for the clients.  It could also free up staff time working though repretive actions to allow a more time for more difficult and more thoughtfull processes. Establishing use of LLM will increase staff productivity which will intern increase results to clients and utlimatly patients.
